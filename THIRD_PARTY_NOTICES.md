# Third-party notices

This file inventories known third-party material in DesktopPet AI Edition 1.0.0. It is not a
representation that every redistribution right has been cleared. The release checklist treats the
unresolved items below as blockers.

The repository-root MIT license applies only to original contributions whose copyright is held by
`bigfnj`. It does not relicense upstream code, artwork, text corpora, models, or libraries.

## Redistribution blockers

- The WinForms engine originated in `Adrianotiger/desktopPet`. That upstream repository has no
  license file or other verified redistribution grant. Obtain written permission or replace the
  code with code under a compatible license before public binary distribution.
- The bundled and downloadable pet sprites have source-specific authorship and copyright notes,
  but a complete redistribution grant is not recorded for every asset. Clear or replace each asset.
- The bundled fortune corpus contains mixed sources, including copyrighted quotations and
  dialogue. Complete a source-by-source rights review and rebuild a cleared corpus before release.
- The optional fortune packs are fan-compiled from mixed public/community sources (fair-use notes are
  not redistribution grants). They are served via the runtime `catalog.json`, which verifies per-file
  SHA-256 integrity but does **not** clear rights: the former per-pack rights gate (`packs.json` with
  `redistributionApproved`, `packaging/pack-rights-evidence.json`, `Test-PackRightsEvidence.ps1`) was
  retired when packs moved to the catalog. Review each pack's redistribution rights by hand and clear,
  replace, or remove uncleared sources before public distribution (see `packs/README.md`).
- Record the exact source revision, conversion procedure, and retained license file for
  `bge-small-en-v1.5` before distribution. Its upstream model card identifies the model as MIT, but
  the repository currently lacks a pinned provenance record for the two shipped model files.

## Bundled with a verified redistribution grant

- **Shimeji base behaviour config** — `tools/ShimejiConvert.Engine/base-conf/actions.xml` and
  `behaviors.xml`, embedded in `ShimejiConvert.Engine.dll`. This is the default behaviour configuration
  from Shimeji-EE (Shimeji English Enhanced), included **unmodified** so the Shimeji Importer can convert
  a sprites-only skin that ships no config of its own. Copyright (c) Shimeji-ee Group under a **3-clause
  BSD** license; the original Shimeji is Copyright (c) 2009 Yuki Yamada / Group Finity
  (http://www.group-finity.com/Shimeji/) under a BSD-style license — both explicitly permit
  redistribution provided the copyright notice is retained, which this notice does. Credit: Kilkakon
  (kilkakon.com) and the Shimeji-EE authors; source https://github.com/gil/shimeji-ee. Full text:
  `tools/ShimejiConvert.Engine/base-conf/NOTICE.txt`. Only the behaviour XML is bundled — never sprite
  art (skin artwork remains the skin author's copyright and the converter never ships it).

The current `src/Fortunes/fortunes.txt` is 1,312,352 bytes with SHA-256
`e7b0ec7abae7c990e919dd417025b0fe432033f3b848f74ef44363a08c9e598f`.
This identifies the audited corpus snapshot; it does not clear any source or quotation.

Current bundled bytes, recorded for identification only (these hashes do not establish provenance
or redistribution rights):

| File | Bytes | SHA-256 |
|---|---:|---|
| `bge-small.onnx` | 34,014,426 | `6c9c6101a956d62dfb5e7190c538226c0c5bb9cb27b651234b6df063ee7dbfe4` |
| `bge-small.vocab.txt` | 231,508 | `07eced375cec144d27c900241f3e339478dec958f92fddbc551f295c992038a3` |

## Source and asset provenance

The engine source, embedded corpus (`src/Fortunes/fortunes.txt`), embedder model
(`src/Models/bge-small.onnx`) and vocabulary, bundled art under `src/Images/` and `src/Resources/`,
and the downloadable pet art under `Pets/` are fan-compiled from mixed upstream and community sources.
Their provenance and attribution are documented here and in [`Readme.md`](Readme.md),
[`packs/README.md`](packs/README.md), and
[`FORTUNE-SOURCES-ASSESSMENT.md`](FORTUNE-SOURCES-ASSESSMENT.md). This is disclosure and attribution,
not a blanket redistribution clearance. (The former hash-bound rights-evidence gate was retired with
the enterprise release pipeline.)

## Locked build inputs and runtime libraries

The runtime libraries and build-only inputs below are pinned by
[`src/packages.lock.json`](src/packages.lock.json). `Microsoft.Net.Compilers.Toolset` and
`Microsoft.NETFramework.ReferenceAssemblies.net48` are private build inputs and are not shipped as
runtime files.

The distributed payload retains these exact legal artifacts:

- Build-only packages are not redistributed in the product payload; their locked NuGet hashes and
  package-declared licenses remain in [`src/packages.lock.json`](src/packages.lock.json).
- `ONNXRUNTIME_LICENSE.txt` and `ONNXRUNTIME_THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt` are copied byte-for-byte from
  the locked Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime 1.28.0 package.
- `NAUDIO_LICENSE.txt` is retained from NAudio commit
  `c89fee940ee6f8d7374d18714a6b85d8b7a18ab0`.
- The base app uses **NAudio 3.0.0-preview.6** (`NAudio.Core`, `NAudio.WinMM`, its transitive `NAudio.Midi`,
  and `NAudio.Dmo` for the device-selectable DirectSound output) for the host-owned audio output. The S2
  Sound module (which bundled NAudio 2.3.0) was retired in B4, so only NAudio 3 ships now.
- `DOTNET_RUNTIME_LICENSE.txt` is copied byte-for-byte from the locked Microsoft.Win32.Registry
  package. The same exact license bytes are carried by the other locked .NET packages that include
  a license file.
- `DOTNET_10_THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt`, `DOTNET_8_THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt`,
  `DOTNET_6_THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt`, and `DOTNET_5_THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt` retain each unique
  third-party-notice byte set shipped by the locked .NET packages. Identical package notice files
  are deduplicated only when their SHA-256 hashes match.

The dependency table above, together with [`src/packages.lock.json`](src/packages.lock.json), is the
runtime inventory.

## Historical documentation support files

The repository retains a generated Sandcastle documentation snapshot under `docs/` for historical
reference. The root Jekyll configuration excludes that entire directory from the public legacy
site, and these files are not part of the DesktopPet application payload. Their licenses still
apply to source-repository distribution:

- `docs/SearchHelp.aspx`, `docs/scripts/branding.js`, and
  `docs/scripts/branding-Website.js` identify their Sandcastle support code as Microsoft Public
  License (Ms-PL). The complete Ms-PL text is reproduced below.
- `docs/scripts/jquery-1.11.0.min.js` is jQuery 1.11.0, copyright 2005, 2014 jQuery Foundation,
  Inc. and other contributors, distributed under the MIT License. The complete MIT text is
  reproduced below.
