    /// fine right up until a host answers null. That is not hypothetical: the app's own
    /// <c>--module-selftest=&lt;id&gt;</c> harness returns null from both GetSettings and GetStorage, and a
    /// module that builds its options SCHEMA during Init (any module whose dropdown options depend on a saved
    /// value) then dies with a NullReferenceException at load time, reported only as "module did not load".
    /// Both first-party modules that hit this were diagnosed the hard way.

    /// The ABI's own convention for a refused service is to degrade, not to throw into a module:
    /// GetCompanionManager returns a refusing instance, RegisterHotkey a no-op handle. This is the same idea for
    /// settings. Every read returns the caller's fallback until something writes, writes are kept for the
    /// life of the object, and <see cref="Save"/> returns false because nothing was persisted.
    ///
    /// Use it as <c>host.GetSettings(Id) ?? new MemoryModuleSettings()</c>. This is a degraded PRODUCTION
    /// path, deliberately not in the Testing namespace: a test double is for asserting behaviour, whereas
    /// this is for surviving a host that gave you nothing.
