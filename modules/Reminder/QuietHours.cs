    /// A "quiet hours" window for the Reminder module: a user-configured span of the day during which the
    /// pet stays silent. It only DECIDES whether a given instant falls inside the window -- it announces
    /// nothing and remembers nothing. The caller (see ReminderModule.CheckDue) uses that decision to skip
    /// SayAll without marking the event fired, so a reminder still fires once the window ends if the event
    /// is still inside its lead-time fire window.
    ///
    /// SETTING SHAPE (recommended): two "HH:mm" 24-hour strings, "quietFrom" and "quietTo".
    ///   * Text, not two Int spinners: one field per boundary reads as a clock time in the options pane, and
    ///     Text round-trips through IModuleSettings.Get/Set exactly as the rest of the module already stores
    ///     values (see "url"/"file"). SettingKind has no Time member (Bool/Int/Text/Enum/Secret/Info), so
    ///     Text is the honest fit; "HH:mm" is culture-neutral and unambiguous.
    ///   * Two strings, not a single "22:00-07:00": each half is independently editable and independently
    ///     validated, and an empty half is a natural "off" signal.
    ///   * BOTH BLANK (or either blank) => the feature is OFF. Any unparseable or out-of-range value is also
    ///     treated as OFF -- the module never suppresses reminders because of a typo, and never throws.
    ///
    /// BOUNDARY CHOICE: the window is half-open [from, to) in local wall-clock minutes -- the start minute is
    /// quiet, the end minute is NOT. So 22:00-07:00 is silent from 22:00:00 up to (but not including) 07:00,
    /// and the 07:00 reminder lands. This matches "reminders resume once quiet hours end".
    ///
    /// from == to => OFF (never quiet). An equal pair is ambiguous between "zero-width window" and "the whole
    /// day"; the whole-day reading would silence reminders forever, which is a footgun, so we treat equal as
    /// disabled -- consistent with the blank-means-off rule.
    ///
    /// PURE + self-contained: no host, no settings, no I/O, no static mutable state. Time comparisons use the
    /// LOCAL time-of-day of the supplied instant (now.ToLocalTime().TimeOfDay), so the result matches the
    /// user's wall clock regardless of the offset carried by <paramref name="now"/>.
