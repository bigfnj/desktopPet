.SYNOPSIS
    Authenticode-sign one or more files with signtool, or do nothing if no certificate is configured.

.DESCRIPTION
    Scaffolding for a code-signing certificate that does not exist yet. Every caller is opt-in on a
    thumbprint, so with no thumbprint supplied this is never invoked and an ordinary build is byte-identical
    to one from before signing existed. That property is not tidiness: build.yml runs both build.ps1 and
    build-installer.ps1 on every pull request, and neither has a certificate.

    Deliberately NOT modelled on the sibling runas-helper project's approach. That hangs signtool off MSBuild
    targets in a .wixproj (SignPublishedApps / SignMsi), and desktopPet has no .wixproj at all -- its MSI is
    produced by invoking the `wix` dotnet tool directly from build-installer.ps1. So the ordering that project
    expresses with AfterTargets/BeforeTargets has to be expressed here as explicit call sites instead.

.PARAMETER Path
    Files to sign. A file that is already validly signed by SOMEONE ELSE is skipped rather than re-signed:
    System.Numerics.Tensors.dll ships with a valid Microsoft signature, and signing over it would replace
    Microsoft's attestation with ours for a binary we did not build.

.PARAMETER Thumbprint
    SHA-1 thumbprint of a code-signing certificate in the current user's store. Empty means do nothing.

.PARAMETER TimestampUrl
    RFC3161 timestamp server. A timestamped signature outlives the certificate, at the cost of MSI
    byte-reproducibility (the token embeds the signing time), which is the property
    Normalize-MsiDeterminism.ps1 exists to preserve. Left to the caller as a conscious trade; empty skips it.

.PARAMETER Description
    What signtool records as the signed content's description (/d), shown in UAC and signature dialogs.
